"""Live progress for a running ``yam-abc-convert`` job.

The converter has no progress protocol: it emits no ``@metric`` lines, and its tqdm bars do
not survive the pipe. So progress is read from what it writes under ``data/`` instead, which
also means it works for a conversion the GUI did not start.

What counts as "done" differs per format, and only one of the two is obvious:

- **abc** writes one ``episode_NNNNNN.mcap`` per finished episode, so the file count is the
  progress.
- **lerobot** (v3) does *not* write per-episode files. ``data/chunk-000/file-000.parquet`` and
  the per-camera ``videos/.../file-000.mp4`` are aggregates that accumulate every episode, so
  counting them tells you nothing. ``meta/info.json`` holds the real counters, and it is only
  rewritten when an episode commits -- progress therefore advances in steps, minutes apart,
  while raw frames are extracted and encoded in between.

Episode counts make a poor progress bar here: takes in one corpus ranged from 88 to 3981
frames, so "4/33 episodes" is only loosely tied to the work done. Frames are linear in it, and
the per-episode frame count can be read from the source timestamps without decoding anything.
