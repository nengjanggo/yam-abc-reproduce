"""Calibrate a passive-GELLO leader: per-joint signs and the home zero.

Reading the GELLO is passive (multi-reader safe), so this can run alongside the GUI.
It never energizes the follower. Two steps:

  monitor  Live per-joint readout (raw rad + calibrated rad + gripper). Wiggle each
           GELLO joint to learn which index it is and which direction it counts.
  zero     Hold the GELLO at the pose you want mapped to the follower's home (all
           follower joints ~0) with the trigger released (it normalizes by distance from
           zero), then capture it. The zero is written into every encoder's EEPROM,
           gripper included (i2rt reset_zero_position), so there are no software offsets
           to persist. Re-run at a new pose to re-zero.

Signs (direction) are found empirically: with teleop running, move one joint; if the
follower goes the opposite way, flip that joint's sign in the station config's
`leader_joint_signs` (or, for one leader only, that controller's `joint_signs`). Use
`monitor` to confirm which index a joint is.

Usage:
  python scripts/calibrate_gello.py monitor --controller left
  python scripts/calibrate_gello.py zero    --controller left
